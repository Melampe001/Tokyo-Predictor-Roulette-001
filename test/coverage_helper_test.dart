// Helper file to import all files for coverage analysis

// Main application files
import 'package:tokyo_roulette_predicciones/main.dart';
import 'package:tokyo_roulette_predicciones/roulette_logic.dart';

// Note: This file helps the coverage tool identify all source files
// that should be included in coverage reports. It's particularly useful
// when some files might not be directly imported by tests.

// To generate coverage:
// flutter test --coverage
// genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html

void main() {
  // This function is intentionally empty
  // The file exists solely to improve coverage tracking
}
